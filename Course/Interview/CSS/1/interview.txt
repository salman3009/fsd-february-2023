CSS - cascading stylesheet 
//It is use for presentation purpose.
//without css also we can able to develop website but presentation will not be good.
//Inside any browser three languages are supported by default 
     1.html 
     2.css 
     3.javascript 
//you can able to run css separately inside the browser.
//always we need to create html page before css.  


css properties:
color:red 
//if you have more then one property semi-colon in between is mandatory for inline style.
color:red;text-align:center;


Writing the css we have three approach:
   1.inline  - within the tag itself you are going to write the style.
   example:
   style="color:red"
   style -> attribute 
   color --> property of css or key of css 
   : --> colon operator
   red --> value of css 
   entire property enclosed with double quotes or single quotes
   2.internal 
      //internal style can be written anywhere inside the html page.
      //mostly it is written in the head tag and sometimes in body tag.
      example:
        <style>
          h2{
            color:red;
            text-align: center;
          } 
          p{
            color:blue;
            text-align: center;
          }      
       </style>
   3.external 
   // we are going to write html and css separately in two files:
   //external.html 
    <head>
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="./external.css">
         //rel - relationship
    </head>
   //external.css
h1{
    color:green;
    text-align: center;
}
Element selector:
/.to select html tags to apply css.
head tag:
//title 
//meta tag 
//link tag

comparison:
1.inline
2.internal
3.external 
first priority:
1.inline -  always priority to inline style
Depends upon the browser last load will be given priority for internal and external
2.internal 
3.external
attribute: !important 
//it will give utmost priority for that style.
//please dont use this propery unnecessary. if something is breaking then only we have to use 
this property.


Basic selector:
1.element selector 
  //we are targeting particular element name.
  //it will apply css for all the tag which is mentioned in entire file 
  example:
   <style>
     h1{
        color:red;
     }
   </style>
2.id selector 
    //id should be unique attribute in entire web page.
    //id is used to target the css for particular element 
    example:
      <style>
    #first-para{
        color:red;
    }    
   </style>
     <p id="first-para">html head body tag</p>
3.class selector 
    //It is combination of group of tags to apply some common css.
      <style>
    .font-styling{
        font-size:10px;
        color:blue;
    }
   </style>
   <body>
    <h1 class="font-styling">Welcome to html</h1>
    <p class="font-styling">font-size,text-algin properties</p>
    <h1 class="font-styling">Welcome to javascript</h1>
</body>
4.grouping selector 
    //combine one or more others selector together 
    //element + id + class 
    <style>
    .font-styling,h4,#heading{
        font-size:10px;
        color:blue;
    } 
   </style>

5.universal selector 
    //it is use to apply for entire web page whatever is written inside this property 
    example:
       <style>
    *{
        color:blue;
    }
   </style>

what is box modal
//Each and every element inside the html will consists of box modal 
//alignment of each element total depends on the adjustment of box modal

1.width and height 
2.padding
   //It will increase or adjustment within around the width and height  
   left,top,right,bottom
3.border

display property:
1.block 
example:<div>,<h1>,<h2>,<h3>,<ol><ul><p><table><form>
display:block
//it will block entire line and next tag will start in new line
//width and height will work here
//mostly we can change the inline to block if requirment is there

2.inline 
example:<span><a>
display:inline
//it will continue in the same line
//width and height will not work here
//block to inline mostly we will not have this requirement.
//inline element will not allow width and height property 

3.inline-block - button,img,input
//it will continue in the same line but will accept the width and height.
//inline to inline-block and block to inline-block.

4flex
